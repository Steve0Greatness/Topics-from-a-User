# Topics from a User
Find all topics made by a user on the [Scratch Forums](https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss). You can find this [hosted on Replit](https://replit.com/@StevesGreatness/Topics-from-a-User)([Webview](https://topics-from-a-user.stevesgreatness.repl.co)).

By the way, this depends on [ScratchDB(V3)](https://scratchdb.lefty.one/v3/docs), and is really slow because it's making a trillion requests to it(mostly on `app.html`).

Also, this site is ugly because I don't want to do styling RN, so this is all you're getting... at least for now.
